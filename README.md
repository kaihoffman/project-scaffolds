# Project Scaffolds
Project scaffolds for various languages with testing etc set up the way I like them.

## How to use this repository
You can clone this repository and copy the files from each language folder (make sure you include invisibles) to a new project to have a test environment and other variables set the way I like to have them.

### Ruby
For any Ruby project, copy the files in ```ruby/``` and run ```bundle install``` in your new project directory. This will install the gems that I tend to use on every project regardless of the focus.
